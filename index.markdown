I am Jonathan. Welcome to my personal webpage.
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working in the [STACK](http://stack.inria.fr/) team
on the [SeDuCe](https://seduce.fr/) testbed for the study of energetical aspects in datacenters.

I have received my PhD from [Ecole des Mines de Nantes](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/fr) in October 2016, by defending
a thesis titled *Contributions to massively distributed Cloud Computing infrastructures*,
under the supervision of  [Frederic Desprez](https://fdesprez.github.io/) and [Adrien LÃ¨bre](https://web.imt-atlantique.fr/x-info/ascola/doku.php?id=internet:members:alebre08:overview).

I have also been involved two years in the technical comitee of [Grid'5000](https://www.grid5000.fr/) and been a 
research engineer during one year on the [Chameleon Cloud](https://www.chameleoncloud.org/) testbed when I was working in [Nimbus](http://www.nimbusproject.org/) team at [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/).
